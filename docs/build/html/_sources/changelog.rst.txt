A library to wrap the Oasys Frew COM interface with pythonic terms and object oriented programming. The aim of frewpy is to make the COM interface accessible to engineers using python. This allows designs to be automated and will play a part in larger automation efforts down the line. Frewpy requires Oasys Frew 19.4 Build 24 as this is the first build that has JSON input/output functionality.
