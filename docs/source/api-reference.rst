API Reference

The frewpy library is made up of multiple core modules. These core modules are brought together in the `FrewModel` object from `frewpy` if the user wishes to use the recommended Object Oriented Programming structure of the library. If users wish to extend the usage of frewpy, they can import core modules and use the functions as building blocks for their purpose. If the result is significant then it could be added to the core library source code for others to use.
