Examples
********

The following code blocks show examples of frewpy in use. All classes, methods and attributes can be found in the `API Reference` section of this documentation. This section can be used to explain how the examples shown below work, and can be used to explore other functionality not shown explicitly. As can be seen in the below examples, there is a standard boilerplate set of code where the file path is defined, and the model is instantiated. Following this, any frewpy functionality can be used.
